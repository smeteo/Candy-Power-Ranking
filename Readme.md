### Context
What’s the best (or at least the most popular) Halloween candy? That was the question this dataset was collected to answer. Data was collected by creating a website where participants were shown [presenting two fun-sized candies and asked to click on the one they would prefer to receive.](http://walthickey.com/2017/10/18/whats-the-best-halloween-candy/) In total, more than 269 thousand votes were collected from 8,371 different IP addresses.
